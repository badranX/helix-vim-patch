## Installation
Rust‚Äôs excellent tooling makes it easy to build this project from source‚Äîjust like Helix itself.
üëâ [Follow the official Helix build guide](https://docs.helix-editor.com/building-from-source.html)

## Vim Supported Keybindings (Partial List)

### Visual Mode & Visual Lines

- `v`, `V`
- `va<char>`, `vi<textobject>` (`<textobject>`: `w`, `W`, `p`...etc)
- Treesitter-related selection such as `vaf` to select a function.
- `gv`

### Operators/Modifiers

- `d`, `dd`, `c`, `cc`, `y`, `yy` 
- `[c|y|d]<motion>`  like `dw`, `dB`
- `[c|y|d]{textobject}` like  `diw`, `da)`, `yi}`
-  Treesitter-related modification keybindings such as `daf` to delete a function or `yaf` to yank a function.

### Navigation

- `*`, `#`, `n`, `N`
- `0`, `^`, `$`
- `f<char>`, `F<char>`, `t<char>`, `T<char>`
- `{`, `}`
- `w`, `W`, `b`, `B`, `e`, `E`
- `gg`, `G`
- `C-^`, `C-6`

### üîç Things to Watch For
This project is not intended to be a replica of Vim, so note the following differences:

- No Ctrl-R for redo ‚Äî Instead, use uppercase U, as in Helix.
- The `%` key is mapped to `match_brackets`, similar to Vim. To revert this mapping or assign it to a custom key, update the Helix configuration as follows:
 ```toml
  [keys.normal]
  "%" = "select_all"
  [keys.select]
  "%" = "select_all"
```
 - Helix allows selections outside of "Select" mode (equivalent to Vim's "Visual" mode). Currently, this patch does not alter that behavior. The added Vim commands will ignore such selections.
 - In Helix, the cursor can be positioned on the newline grapheme at the end of a line. This can result in different paste behavior when using the `p` and `P` commands.

Some of these differences might be removed in the future.
